# BASIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR EDITING THIS ELIZA DATA FILE
#
#  * This data file has been released with ECC-Eliza V3.65. *
#
# This data file is compatible with ECC-Eliza versions 3.65 and later!
#
# Defenitions:
#
# Keyword-Reply Block: A block of possible keywords that start with "K ", and
# the possible replies for them starting with "R ". Such block is always
# separated from other blocks using two lines of character "#", one at the
# begining of the block, and one at the end.
#
# The "#" sign represents a note or a break between keyword-reply blocks.
#
# K represents keywords and may be an expression.
# R represents a possible reply for that keyword (if it was found)
#
# Char | represents the name of the patient.
# Char * represents all of the text found AFTER the identifyed keyword.
# Char \ represents the keyword which was analyzed in the user's query.
# Char ^ represents the time of day Eliza encounters using internal clock.
#
# The text displayed by * and \ goes through a pronouns reversing process.
# This means that if the original text was "SO YOU KNOW ME", it will be
# changed to: "SO I KNOW YOU", etc. Take that in mind.
#
# Notes:
#
# If you want to add new keywords you should see if one of the replys
# contains the backslash sign (\). This sign means that the keyword analyzed
# (which is surely one of the keywords of that block), will be displayed.
# Make sure it fits your situation, because if it doesn't fit the new keyword
# it might not sound logical.
#
# Sometimes even though a keyword appears in a sentence the program will
# skip to find another keyword (this is done in a random).
#
# There is no need and you shouldn't add any punctuation marks to the
# keywords EXCEPT for "'" because Eliza filters the rest of them.
# If the user enters character "`" it will automatically be converted to "'".
#
# The ^ character will display the time of day. This may have a few formats:
#
# 1. Holiday name. Example: HALOWEEN, INDEPENDENCE DAY, etc.
# 2. Time of day.  Example: NOON, EVENING, etc.
# 3. Day of week.  Example: FRIDAY, SUNDAY, may also be WEEKEND.
# 4. Day of week + Time of day. Example: MONDAY AFTERNOON.
#
#
# Another very important note is the order of the keywords. For example,
# if you have a keyword-reply block which seeks for the keyword "WHY", and
# later you have a keyword-reply block which seeks for the keyword "WHY IS",
# the second option will not take place, because "WHY IS" already contains
# the word "WHY" which will be checked earlier, hence: if "WHY" is included
# the keyword block which contains "WHY" will be activated, and if not then
# it surely doesn't contain "WHY IS"...
#
# Also: There is always a little random chance that the keyword will be
#       skipped even if found, but don't count on that.
#
# Errors: If an error is made in this data file, Eliza will notify you of
#         the line number and it's context which caused the conflict, at
#         the time it loads itself.
